## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Track multiple Roblox user IDs for presence changes.
- ‚è±Ô∏è Set custom tracking intervals.
- ü™ù Event-driven architecture with two key events:
  - `UserOnlinePresenceChanged` ‚Äî triggered when a user's online status changes.
  - `TrackingErrorOccurred` ‚Äî triggered when an error occurs during tracking.
- üëç Easy to use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Install the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package RobloxUserOnlineTracker
```

Or via the [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RobloxUserOnlineTracker).

---

### Usage

#### Tracking example

```csharp
using RobloxUserOnlineTracker;

var tracker = new RobloxUserOnlineTrackerClient(".ROBLOSECURITY_COOKIE_HERE");

tracker.UserOnlinePresenceChanged += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"User {args.UserPresence.User.Id} is now {args.UserPresence.UserPresence}");
};

tracker.TrackingErrorOccurred += (sender, ex) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error occurred: {ex.Message}");
};

long[] userIdsToTrack = { 123456, 789012 };
tracker.StartTracking(userIdsToTrack, trackInterval: 10000); // Every 10 seconds
```

#### Onetime call example

```csharp
using RobloxUserOnlineTracker;

var tracker = new RobloxUserOnlineTrackerClient(".ROBLOSECURITY_COOKIE_HERE");

long[] userIds = { 123456, 789012 };
var usersStatusOnline = await tracker.GetUserOnlinePresenceAsync(userIds);
```

### Real use case (old version, the code may changes)

In the following screenshots I have included a real use case. I decide to track the online status of myself and another test account and send a real-time notification to myself with Telegram using a bot. Finally I started the application in a Docker container.
